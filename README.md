# School_District_Analysis 

## Overview
The chief data scientist from the state school board has requested that an analysis be conducted on the school districts standardized test results for high school students in both math and reading.  The initial school district analysis included a snapshot of the district's key metrics.  The analyis then went on to show key metrics for each school including: top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools based on overall passing rate, average math and reading scores received by students in each grade level, school performance based on the budget per student, performance based on school size, and performance based on school type. 

It was later discolvered that there may have been occurrences of academic dishonesty in one of the district's schools, Thomas High School, at the ninth grade level.  The analysis was performed again, but with this particular school's ninth grade math and reading test scores nullified. The results from the analysis excluding the Thomas High School ninth grade test results are explained below.  

## Results 
To isolate and replace the math and reading test scores with a null value of 'NaN' the following code was used on the student_data data frame:
